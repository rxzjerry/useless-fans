### Project Description
It finds the speed of fan by giving a video of a rotating fan.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Measuring the rotational speed (RPM) of a fan usually requires physical tachometers or specialized sensors, which can be expensive and impractical for everyday use. In many cases, users want a non-contact way to measure fan speed using just a camera or smartphone, without installing any hardware.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This project uses computer vision with OpenCV and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to detect when the fan blades return to the same position in a video. By calculating the time between these repeated positions, the program estimates the fan's rotations per minute (RPM) accurately ‚Äî all from a simple video, without any extra equipment.
